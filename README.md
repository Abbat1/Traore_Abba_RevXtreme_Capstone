READ-ME FOR CAPSTONE PROJECT "REVXTREME"

WHAT: This project is based upon my passion for modified sports cars. 
RevXtreme is a company/website that tailored its market towards buying and selling used/ new modified sport cars.

WHY: You might be curious about why we're focusing on a website dedicated solely to modified cars.
In todayâ€™s digital age, purchasing a vehicle has become incredibly straightforward with just a few taps on your phone.
Our aim is to enhance this experience by zeroing in on modified vehicles. 
Imagine a specialized platform where you can easily find custom rides tailored to your preferences, all without the usual complications. 
We actively monitor market trends to ensure our inventory is on point, providing a streamlined alternative to traditional dealerships, but with the added convenience of online access.

How: We at RevXreme plan on utilizing multiple strategies to acquire a content inventory.
We well network with custom shops(Establish relationships with reputable custom car shops and builders. 
These connections can provide a steady stream of modified vehicles and valuable insights into popular modifications and trends),
partner with car enthusiast communities(Engage with online forums, social media groups, and local car clubs.
These communities are often where modified car enthusiasts gather and share their vehicles for sale or trade), attend car shows and auctions( Participate in car shows, auctions, and racing events.
These venues are prime spots for discovering high-quality modified cars and connecting with sellers who might be looking to offload their customized rides),
and building relationships with overseas vehicle importers(Modified cars often come from overseas markets. Partnering with importers who specialize in modified vehicles can give you access to unique cars not readily available locally).
